This repository contains the implementation of the methods and experiments presented in the paper "Implicit Transfer Operator Learning: Multiple Time-Resolution Surrogates for Molecular Dynamics". It focuses on reproducing the results for AlanineDipeptide, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in molecular dynamics simulations.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies for ITO.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

```
Git
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
```

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/matschreiner/ito
$ cd ito
```

### Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run:

```
$ make install-{arch}
```

Replace {arch} with your target architecture:

cpu for CPU-only installations.
cu118 for systems with CUDA 11.8.
cu121 for systems with CUDA 12.1.

This command will install all package dependencies and the appropriate wheels for pytorch-scatter, pytorch-sparse, pytorch, and pytorch-cluster, which are necessary for pytorch-geometric.


## Usage
This section provides instructions on how to run simulations, train models, and reproduce the results presented in the paper. Examples of command lines and descriptions of available scripts and options are included for ease of use.

Training the TLDDPM Model
Scripts for training models and generating trajectories are located in the scripts directory.

### Train a Model
To train a TLDDPM model, use the following command:

```
python scripts/train_tlddpm.py
```

This script comes with several configurable arguments to customize your training session. To see all available arguments for the training script, run:

```
python scripts/train_tlddpm.py --help
```

This command will display the following options:

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH           Base directory for storing data and checkpoints.
  --n_features N_FEATURES
                        Number of features for the score model.
  --n_layers N_LAYERS   Number of layers in the score model.
  --epochs EPOCHS       Number of training epochs.
  --diff_steps DIFF_STEPS
                        Number of diffusion steps in the model.
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size for training.
  --lr LR               Learning rate for the optimizer.
  --max_lag MAX_LAG     Maximum lag to consider in the ALA2 trajectories.
  --fixed_lag           Enable to use a fixed lag value, disabled by default.
  --indistinguishable   Enable this flag to treat atoms as indistinguishable.
  --unscaled            Use unscaled data. When disabled, data is scaled to unit variance.
```

Upon completion of the training, a symbolic link to the model checkpoint with the lowest loss will be created. You can find this link at:

```
storage/train/{timestamp}/best
```

### Sampling from model
After training a model, you can generate trajectories by sampling from it. This is achieved by using the sample_tlddpm.py script.

To sample trajectories from a trained model, execute the following command:

```
python scripts/sample_tlddpm.py {checkpoint}
```

Replace {checkpoint} with the path to the checkpoint file of the model you wish to use for sampling. The script comes with several configurable arguments to customize your sampling. To see all available arguments for the training script, run:

```
python scripts/sample_tlddpm.py --help
```

This command will display the following options:

```
positional arguments:
  checkpoint            Path to the model checkpoint file for generating trajectories.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH           Base path for input data and where output samples will be stored.
  --samples SAMPLES     The number of initial positions to sample trajectories from, processed in parallel.
  --traj_length TRAJ_LENGTH
                        The total number of steps (frames) in each generated trajectory.
  --lag LAG             Temporal lag between consecutive steps (frames) in the generated trajectory.
  --ode_steps ODE_STEPS
                        Number of steps for the ODE solver during sampling. Set to 0 for normal denoising.
  --indistinguishable   Enable this flag to treat atoms as indistinguishable in the model.
  --unscaled            Enable this flag to use unscaled data. By default, data is scaled to have unit variance.
```

By default, the trajectories generated by this script are saved in the following location:

```
storage/samples/{timestamp}/trajectory.npy
```

The {timestamp} in the directory name is replaced with the timestamp when the sampling process started.
